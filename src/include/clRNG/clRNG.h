/*! @mainpage Introduction
 *
 *  We introduce clRNG, an OpenCL library for generating uniform random numbers.
 *  It provides multiple streams that are created on the host computer 
 *  and used to generate random numbers either on the host or on computing devices by work items.
 *  Such multiple streams are essential for parallel simulation \cite rLEC14p
 *  and are often useful as well for simulation on a single processing element  
 *  (or within a single work item), for example when comparing similar systems 
 *  via simulation with common random numbers \cite sLAW14a, \cite vLEC07e,
 *  \cite iLEC08j, \cite rLEC02a .
 *  Streams can also be divided into segments of equal length called substreams,
 *  as in \cite rLEC91a, \cite rLEC02a, \cite iLEC08j .
 *  Currently, the library implements the following three generators: 
 *  MRG31k3p \cite rLEC00b, MRG32k3a \cite rLEC99b, LFSR113 \cite rLEC99a and
 *  Philox-4Ã—32-10 \cite rSAL11a .
 *  
 *
 *  ### Generators and prefixes
 *
 *  The API is, in large part, the same for every generator, with only the
 *  prefix of the type and function names that changes across generators.
 *  For example, to use the MRG31k3p generator, one needs to include the
 *  corresponding header file (which is normally the lowercase name of the
 *  generator with a \c .h extension on the host, or a \c .clh extension on
 *  the device) and use type and function names that start with \c clrngMrg31k3p:
 *  \code
 *  #include <clRNG/mrg31k3p.h>
 *
 *  cl_double foo(clrngMrg31k3pStream* stream) {
 *    return clrngMrg31k3pRandomU01(stream);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *  (The above function just returns a number uniformly distributed in
 *  \f$(0,1)\f$ generated using the stream passed as its argument.)
 *  To use the LFSR113 generator instead of MRG31k3p, one must change the
 *  include directive and use type and function names that start with \c clrngLfsr113:
 *  \code
 *  #include <clRNG/lfsr113.h>
 *
 *  cl_double foo(clrngLfsr113Stream* stream) {
 *    return clrngLfsr113RandomU01(stream);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  In the generator API reference (given in \ref clRNG_template.h), the
 *  generator-specific part of the prefix is not shown.
 *  The \ref clRNG.h header file declares common function across different
 *  generators and also utility library functions.
 *
 *  Future versions of the library will support more generic
 *  interfaces that work across generators.
 *
 *
 *  ### Environment variables
 *
 *  For all features of the library to work properly, the \c CLRNG_ROOT
 *  environment variable must be set to point to the installation path of the 
 *  clRNG package, that is, the directory under which lies the \c include/clRNG
 *  subdirectory.
 *  Means of setting an environment variable depend on the operating system 
 *  used.
 *
 *
 *  \section small_examples Small examples
 *
 *  In the examples given below, we use the MRG31k3p from \cite rLEC00b . 
 *  In general, a stream object contains three states:
 *  the initial state of the stream (or seed), 
 *  the initial state of the current substream (by default it is equal to the seed),
 *  and the current state.  With MRG31k3p, each state is comprised of six 31-bit integers.
 *  Each time a random number is generated, the current state advances by one position.
 *  There are also functions to reset the state to the initial one, 
 *  or to the beginning of the current substream, or to the start of the next substream.
 *  Streams can be created and manipulated in arrays of arbitrary sizes.
 *  For a single stream, one uses an array of size 1.
 *  One can separately declare and allocate memory for an array of streams,
 *  create (initialize) the streams, clone them, copy them to preallocated space, etc. 
 *
 *  
 *  \subsection small_examples_host Using streams on the host
 *
 *  We start with a small example in which we just create a few streams,
 *  then use them to generate numbers on the host computer and compute some quantity.
 *  This could be done as well by using only a single stream, but we use more 
 *  just for the purpose of illustration.
 *  
 *  The code includes the header for the MRG31k3p RNG.
 *  \snippet HostOnly/hostonly.c clRNG header
 *  We create an array of two streams named \c streams
 *  and a single stream named \c single.
 *  \snippet HostOnly/hostonly.c create streams
 *  Then we repeat the following 100 times:
 *  we generate a uniform random number in \f$(0,1)\f$ and an integer in
 *  \f$\{1,\dots,6\}\f$, and compute the indicator that the product is less
 *  than 2.
 *  \snippet HostOnly/hostonly.c iterate streams
 *  The uniform random numbers over \f$(0,1)\f$ are generated by alternating the two
 *  streams from the array.
 *  We then print the average of those indicators.
 *  \snippet HostOnly/hostonly.c output
 * 
 *
 *  \subsection small_examples_device Using streams in work items
 *  
 *  In our second example, we create an array of streams and use them  
 *  in work items that execute in parallel on a GPU device, one distinct stream per work item.
 *  Note that it is also possible (and sometimes useful) to use more than one stream per work item.
 *  We show only fragments of the code, to illustrate what we do with the streams.
 *  This code is only for illustration; the program does no useful computation.
 *  
 *  In the host code, we first include the clRNG header for the MRG31k3p RNG:
 *  \snippet WorkItem/workitem.c clRNG header
 *  Now suppose we have an integer variable \c numWorkItems that indicates the 
 *  number of work items we want to use.  
 *  We create an array of \c numWorkItems streams (and allocate memory for both 
 *  the array and the stream objects).
 *  The creator returns in the variable \c streamBufferSize the size of the buffer 
 *  that this array occupies (it depends on how much space is required to store the stream states),
 *  and an error code.
 *  \snippet WorkItem/workitem.c create streams
 *  Then we create an OpenCL buffer of size \c streamBufferSize and fill it with a copy of 
 *  the array of streams, to pass to the device.
 *  We also create and pass a buffer that will be used by the device to return 
 *  an array of \c numWorkItems values of type \c cl_double.
 *  (OpenCL buffer creation is not specific to clRNG, so it is not discussed here).
 *  \snippet WorkItem/workitem.c create streams buffer
 *  \snippet WorkItem/workitem.c create output buffer
 *  We finally enqueue the kernel with these two buffers as kernel arguments (not shown here).
 *  
 *  In the device code, we include the device-side clRNG header for the chosen RNG
 *  (it ends with `.clh` instead of `.h`).
 *  \snippet WorkItem/workitem_kernel.cl clRNG header
 *  Pointers to the global memory buffers 
 *  received from the host and to the output array are passed to the kernel as arguments.
 *  (The correspondence between the kernel arguments and the buffers on the host is
 *  specified in the host code, not shown here).
 *  For each work item, we create a private copy of its stream, named \c private_stream,
 *  in its private memory, so we can generate random numbers on the device.
 *  The private memory must be allocated at compile time; this is why
 *  \c private_stream is not declared as a pointer, so the declaration allocates memory.
 *  The kernel just generates two random numbers and returns the sum, in a \c cl_double.
 *  \snippet WorkItem/workitem_kernel.cl kernel
 *  The host can then recover the array of size \c numWorkItems that contains these sums.
 *
 *
 *  \subsection specialized_API RNG-Specific API's
 *
 *  \ref clRNG_template.h describes the random streams API as it is intended to
 *  be implemented using different types of RNG's or even using quasi-Monte
 *  Carlo (QMC) point sets.
 *
 *  In the description of this API, every data type and function name is
 *  assigned the prefix `clrng`.  It is understood that, in the implementation
 *  for each RNG type, the prefix `clrng` is to be expanded with another prefix
 *  that indicates the type of RNG (or other method) used.
 *
 *  As this API is not polymorphic, replacing an RNG type with another one in
 *  client code requires changing the code to match clRNG function names and
 *  data types to match those of the replacement RNG.
 *  We also intend to propose a generic (in the polymorphic sense) interface to
 *  the clRNG library.
 *
 *
 *  \subsection objects_vs_states Stream Objects and Stream States
 *
 *  The library defines, among others, two closely related types of structures:
 *  stream objects (clrngStream) and stream states (clrngStreamState).  The
 *  definitions of both structures depend on the specific type of RNG that they
 *  pertain to. 
 *  Stream states correspond to the seeds of conventional RNG's, to counter
 *  values in counter-based RNG's, or to point and coordinate indices in QMC
 *  methods.
 *  Normally, the client should not deal with stream states directly, but use
 *  instead the higher-level stream objects.
 *  Stream objects are intended to store several stream
 *  states: the current and initial stream states, but also current substream
 *  state when support for substreams is available.
 *  Stream objects may also store other properties of the RNG, such as
 *  encryption keys for cryptography-based RNG's.
 *
 *
 *  \subsection stream_arrays Arrays of Stream Objects
 *
 *  Many functions are defined only for arrays of stream objects and not for
 *  single stream objects.  It is always possible to use these functions for
 *  single stream objects by specifying a unit array size.
 *
 *  Also, in order to comply with the OpenCL API and be consistent with the
 *  clBLAS API, functions that take an array as an argument have the array size
 *  argument come *before* the array argument.
 *
 *
 *  \subsection device_storage Storing Stream States on the Device
 *
 *  When a kernel is called, the stream states it needs are normally passed by
 *  the host and stored in global memory.
 *  For efficiency reasons, it is desirable that the current stream state be
 *  first copied in a work-item's private memory, and to work with
 *  that copy inside the kernel.
 *  In the current implementation of clRNG, to avoid wasting device resources,
 *  only the current stream state is stored in the work-item's private memory.
 *  The initial stream state is left in global memory and
 *  a pointer to it is stored in the work-item's private memory.
 *  When substream support is turned on (by defining CLRNG_ENABLE_SUBSTREAMS
 *  before including the device-side header file; see \ref clRNG_template.h),
 *  the initial state of the substream is stored in the work-item's private
 *  memory together with the current state.
 *
 *
 *  \subsection device_side_code Device-Side Code
 *
 *  To use the clRNG library on a device from within a user-defined kernel, the
 *  user must include the clRNG header file corresponding to the desired RNG,
 *  using an `include` preprocessor directive.
 *
 *  If default settings are not suitable for the user's needs, optional library
 *  behavior can be selected by defining specific preprocessor macros *before*
 *  including the clRNG header.
 *  For example, to enable substreams support on the device while using the
 *  MRG31k3p generator, use:
 *  \code{c}
 *      #define  CLRNG_ENABLE_SUBSTREAMS
 *      #include <clRNG/mrg31k3p.clh>
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  A comprehensive list of supported device-side library options are described
 *  in \ref clRNG_template.h.
