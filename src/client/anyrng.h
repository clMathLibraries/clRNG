/*! @file  anyrng.h
 *  @brief Link names of the generic API to a given RNG's API.
 *
 *  The purposose of this file is to facilitate testing the examples against
 *  different RNG implementations.
 *
 *  Exactly one of the preprocessor symbols \c USE_MRG31K3P, \c USE_MRG32K3A or
 *  \c USE_LFSR113 must be defined before including this header file.
 *
 *  The following preprocessor symbols are defined:
 *  - \c RNG_HOST_HEADER expands to the name of the RNG header file for the
 *    host code, surrounded with angle brackets;
 *  - \c RNG_DEVICE_HEADER expands to the name of the RNG header file for the
 *    device code, surrounded with angle brackets;
 *  - \c RNG_PREFIX expands to the RNG prefix that is normally expanded after
 *    the common \c clrng prefix, e.g., \c Mrg31k3p for the MRG31k3p RNG;
 *    host code, surrounded with angle brackets;
 *  - \c RNG_PREFIX_S and \c RNG_DEVICE_HEADER_S respectively expand to the
 *    values of \c RNG_PREFIX and \c RNG_DEVICE_HEADER, but surrounded with
 *    quotes (stringified);
 *  - \c RNG_DEVICE_HEADER expands to the name of the RNG header file for the
 *    device code, surrounded with angle brackets;
 *  - the clRNG API types and functions in a generic form, i.e., without the
 *    name of the RNG expanded after the \c clrng prefix.
 *
 *  To use the MRG31k3p generator, write:
 *
 *      #define USE_MRG31K3P
 *      #include <clRNGgen.h>
